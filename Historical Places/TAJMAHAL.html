<h2>TAJMAHAL</h2> 
<p><bold>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompa
sses nearly 17 hectares, 
in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz 
Mahal with 
construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gate
way on the 
south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of 
several 
historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its 
construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans we
re 
requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the
main architect 
of the Taj Mahal.The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of I
ndo-Islamic 
architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and 
convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combinatio
n of lush 
green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. Th
e relief work 
in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. The uniqueness of Taj 
Mahal lies in 
some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such
genius 
planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which add
ed rich 
depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb vari
ety. 
The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended 
beyond 
the square at the corners. The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre 
of 
the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb cha
mber in the 
centre, encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The e
xterior of 
the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners. The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the c
enotaphs of 
Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite octagonal marble lattice screen encircl
ing both 
cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. The bord
ers of the 
frames are inlaid with precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the 
shades of 
the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in perfe
ct centre of 
the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with inlaid flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Sh
ah Jahan is 
greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west. The upp
er cenotaphs 
are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the imperial Mu
ghal tombs. 
The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown dimension to the Mughal
architecture. 
The four minarets provide not only a kind of spatial reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional 
effect to the 
edifice.The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands majesticall
y in the centre 
of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden
in front of 
the galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the 
narrower 
cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east an
d west have a 
pavilion at the centre.The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral sym
metry along 
a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered 
with red 
sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Ta
j Mahal 
complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large pl
atform 
over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblo
ng massive 
prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal ar
ches and the 
spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the 
arches bordered 
with rope molding.</bold></p>
