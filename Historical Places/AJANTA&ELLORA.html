<h2>Ajanta & Ellora Caves</h2> 
<p><bold>The first Buddhist cave monuments at Ajanta date from the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. During the Gup
ta period (5th and 6th centuries A.D.), 
many more richly decorated caves were added to the original group. The paintings and sculptures of Ajant
a, considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious 
art, have had a considerable artistic influence.These 34 monasteries and temples, extending over more than
2 km, were dug side by side in the wall of a 
high basalt cliff, not far from Aurangabad, in Maharashtra. Ellora, with its uninterrupted sequence of monu
ments dating from A.D. 600 to 1000, brings the 
civilization of ancient India to life. Not only is the Ellora complex a unique artistic creation and a technolo
gical exploit but, with its sanctuaries devoted 
to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it illustrates the spirit of tolerance that was characteristic of ancient I
ndia.The invaluable ensemble of 34 caves at Ellora 
in the Charanandri hills of western India’s Maharashtra State showcases a spirit of co-existence and religio
us tolerance through the outstanding architectural 
activities carried out by the followers of three prominent religions: Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. 
The rock-cut activity was carried out in three phases 
from the 6th century to the 12th century. The earliest caves (caves 1–12), excavated between the 5th and 8t
h centuries, reflect the Mahayana philosophy of Buddhism 
then prevalent in this region. The Brahmanical group of caves (caves 13–29), including the renowned Kail
asa temple (cave 16), was excavated between the 7th and 10th 
centuries. The last phase, between the 9th and 12th centuries, saw the excavation of a group of caves (cave
s 30–34) reflecting Jaina philosophy.The caves at Ajanta 
are excavated out of a vertical cliff above the left bank of the river Waghora in the hills of Ajanta. They ar
e thirty in number, including the unfinished ones, of 
which five (caves 9, 10, 19, 26 and 29) are chaityagrihas (sanctuary) and the rest, sangharamas or viharas (
monastery). The caves are connected with the river by 
rock-cut staircases. The excavation activity was carried out in two different phases separated by an interval
of about four centuries. The first phase coincides 
with the rule of the Satavahana dynasty from about the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE, while the
second phase corresponds to the Basim branch of the 
Vakataka dynasty with their Asmaka and Rishika feudatories in the 5th to 6th centuries CE.Altogether, six
caves (caves 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A) were excavated in 
the first phase by Hinayana/Theravadin followers of Buddhism, wherein Buddha was worshipped in an ani
conic/symbolic form. These caves are simple and austere, and 
carry mural paintings sparsely. The chaityagrihas are characterized by a vaulted ceiling and an apsidal end,
the façade dominated by a horseshoe-shaped window, 
known as chaitya window. Internally, they are divided by colonnades into a central nave and side aisles, th
e latter continuing behind the apse for circumambulation. 
At the centre of the apse stands the object of worship in the form of a chaitya or stupa, also hewn out of th
e rock. The monasteries consist of an astylar hall meant 
for congregation, and range of cells on three sides serving as the dwelling-apartments (viharas) for monks.
Amongst the caves of the Buddhist group, Cave 10 
(Visvakarma or Sutar-ki-jhopari, the Carpenter’s cave), Cave 11, and Cave 12 (Teen Tal, or three-storied 
monastery, the largest in this category) are particularly 
important. These caves mark the development of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism and represent a host of 
Buddhist deities. The prominent caves of the Brahmanical group 
are Cave 15 (Dasavatara, or Cave of Ten Incarnations), Cave 16 (Kailasa, the largest monolithic temple), 
Cave 21 (Ramesvara), and Cave 29 (Dumar Lena). Amongst these, 
Cave 16 is an excellent example of structural innovation, and marks the culmination of rock-cut architectur
e in India featuring elaborate workmanship and striking proportions. 
The temple is decorated with some of the boldest and finest sculptural compositions to be found in India. T
he sculpture depicting Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailasa, 
the abode of Siva, is especially noteworthy. The remains of beautiful paintings belonging to different perio
ds are preserved on the ceilings of the front mandapa (pillared hall) 
of this temple. The Jaina group of caves (caves 30 – 34) is exquisitely carved with fine, delicate sculptures,
and includes fine paintings dedicated to the Digambara sect. 
Through their art and architecture, the Ellora Caves serve as a window to ancient India, including socio-cul
tural phenomena, material culture, politics, and lifestyles.
