<h2>TANJORE BIG TEMPLE</h2> 
<p><bold>Brihadeeshwara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjav
ur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajesvaram. It is one of the largest templ
es in India and is an example of 
Dravidian architecture during the Chola period. Built by emperor Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010
AD, the temple turned 1000 years old 
in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the “Great Living Chola Templ
es”, with the other two being the 
Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple.The temple stands amidst fo
rtified walls that were probably added in the 
16th century. The vimanam (temple tower) is 216 ft (66 m) high and is the tallest in the world. The Kumba
m (the apex or the bulbous structure on 
the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons.There is a big statue of Nan
di (sacred bull), carved out of a 
single rock measuring about 16 ft (4.9 m) long and 13 ft (4.0 m) high at the entrance. The entire temple str
ucture is made out of granite, the 
nearest sources of which are about 60 km to the west of temple. The temple is one of the most visited touri
st attractions in Tamil Nadu. 
Arulmozhivarman, a Tamil emperor who was popular as Rajaraja Chola I laid out foundations of Brihadee
swarar Temple during 1002 CE. It was first 
among other great building projects by Tamil Chola. A symmetrical and axial geometry rules layout of this
temple. Temples from same period and 
two following centuries are expressions of Tamils Chola power, artistic expertise and wealth. Emergence o
f these types of features, such as 
multifaceted columns along with projecting signals of square capitals signifies arrival of Chola style, whic
h was new at that time. 
It is one architectural exemplar, which showcases true form of Dravida kind of architecture in temples and 
is a representative of ideology of 
Chola Empire and Southern India’s Tamil civilization. Brihadeeswarar Temple “testifies to Chola’s brillia
nt achievements in architecture, painting, 
bronze casting and sculpture.”It is said that after seeing Pallava Rajasimha Temples in Kanchipuram, Emp
eror Rajaraja Cholan had the dream of 
establishing such a huge temple for Lord Shiva. Brihadeeswarar Temple is first among all buildings, which
make use of granite fully and it finished 
within five years from 1004 AD to 1009 AD.The greatest of Chola emperors Rajaraja-I (985 A.D – 1012 
A.D) the son of Sundara Chola (Parantaka-II) and 
Vanavan mahadevi built this magnificent temple named Brihadeeswarar at Thanjavur – the capital of Cho
la dynasty.From the Epigraphical evidence it is 
known about Rajaraja-I started building this temple on his 19th year and completed on 275th day of his 25
th year. It took just 6 years to complete 
this work on 1010 A.D.The Chola reign declined and they were ousted by the Pandyas who were in turn th
rown over by the Vijayanagara Empire. In 1535, 
the Vijayanagara king installed a Nayak king and the clan, called Tanjore Nayaks, reigned till the mid-17th
century. In 1674, the Marathas conquered 
Tanjore. Later, like the rest of the country, Thanjavur too fell into British hands.The inscriptions and fresc
oes on the walls of Brihadeeswarar Temple 
record the rise and fall of the city’s fortunes. Shiva’s representation is as a gigantic stone lingam. This is c
overed by a vimanam that extends to 216 feet. 
It is built with stones that are bonded and notched without any mortar. The topmost stone, an engineering 
marvel, weighs about eighty tons.Rajaraja-I named 
this temple as Rajarajesvaram and the deity Shiva in Linga form as Peruvudaiyar, the temple is also known
in the deity’s name as Peruvudaiyarkovil . 
In later period Maratta and Nayaks rulers constructed various shrines and gopurams of the temple.The Bri
hadeeswarar Temple was completed in around 1010 in 
the southeastern part of the new capital Thanjavur constructed in the basin of the Kaveri (Cauvery) River b
y the king of the Chola Dynasty, Rajaraja I 
(r. 985-1014). It has also been called Rajarajesvara Temple after the king’s name. It is one of the two great
est temples from the age of the Chola Dynasty 
together with the Rajendra -Cholisvara Temple built in the next new capital, Gangaikondacholapuram, whi
ch was constructed by his successor Rajendra I. Those 
constructions were prodigious national projects showing the Chola Empire’s hegemony in south India.It is 
said that the Brihadeeswarar Temple was erected in 
only seven years. Its precincts are surrounded with cloisters covering an area of 120m by 240m and are als
o surrounded outside with heavy brick walls for an 
area of 350m square including a large tank (reservoir).There is a Nandi Shrine, two continuous extensive 
Mandapas (worship rooms), an Antarala (antechamber), 
and a Vimana with a high tower, all in line on the east-west axis.On the same axis stand Gopurams (temple
gateways) of the early phase at the eastern center of 
the cloister and the brick wall. They are the sole entrance spots to the temple precincts.
